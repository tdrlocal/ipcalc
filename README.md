# ipcalc
Simple IP calculator based on Python's ipcalc and netaddr library. This is just for repository purposes, the code has been developed at least 6 years+ ago. I use this normally for quick investigation and/or verification while doing security analysis.

Executable file (converted from py2exe) should be compatible to run in most Windows7 and Windows 10. 
Python code was developed in Python 2.7+ base.

-s is for simple output 
<p> -v is for verbose output with all of the IP addresses

Example running in Python output:
